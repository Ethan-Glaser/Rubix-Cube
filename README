Rubix Cube is a personal project that I created August 2019.
This is a 3D rendering of a fully fuctioning rubix cube. 
You can use the arrow keys along with ctrl and alt to rotate along
the x y and z planes and you can use the number keys to turn the rows
of the cube. The cube can easily be midified to change to any size dimention
ie 3x3, 4x4, 10x10 etc.
